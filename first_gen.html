                <h2>Who We Are</h2>
                <p>The First-Generation Student Program is grounded in a history of student activism. First-Generation
                    College Students @UM, a student organization, was founded in 2007 with the mission to increase
                    accessibility to resources for first-generation students and to build community among the
                    population. The students advocated for greater campus support for themselves and other peer
                    first-generation students. </p>

                <p>The First Generation Student Gateway serves as a starting point to get connected to resources for
                    first-generation students. Housed in the Office of Academic Multicultural Initiatives (OAMI), the
                    Gateway is linked to several partner offices and is a home for support for first-generation
                    students. The Gateway is for all first-generation undergraduate and graduate students and their
                    allies. </p>

                <h2>Our Stories</h2>
                <p>U-M faculty, students and staff who are first-generation students and graduates proudly share their
                    stories. We’d like to hear from you too. What has your experience been like as a first-gen at U-M?
                    We
                    are collecting stories from first-generation college students who have a connection to the
                    University of
                    Michigan. If you are an alumnus/alumna, faculty, staff or student from U-M, we would love to share
                    your
                    story.

                    <p>My advice to any first-generation college student is to not let anything (imposter syndrome,
                        environmental or societal influences, people, life circumstances, etc.) deter you from
                        accomplishing
                        any goals you have set for yourself.</p>

                    <p>Seek as much help as you can. Whether it's from faculty, friends, or organizations, the more help
                        you
                        have to navigate college will help you tremendously in your journey to succeed.</p>

                    <p>It's perfectly normal not to have everything figured out from the start; trust the process, be

                        to new possibilities, and let your status as a first-gen student be a source of pride.</p>
