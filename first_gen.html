            <h2>Who we are</h2>
            <p>The First-Generation Student Program is grounded in a history of student activism. First-Generation College Students @UM, a student organization, was founded in 2007 with the mission to increase accessibility to resources for first-generation students and to build community among the population. The students advocated for greater campus support for themselves and other peer first-generation students. </p>

            <h2>Our Stories</h2>
            <p>U-M faculty, students and staff who are first-generation students and graduates proudly share their stories. We’d like to hear from you too. What has your experience been like as a first-gen at U-M? We are collecting stories from first-generation college students who have a connection to the University of Michigan. If you are an alumnus/alumna, faculty, staff or student from U-M, we would love to share your story. </p>

                <h3>Joseph Ballard II</h3>
                <p>My advice to any first-generation college student is to not let anything (imposter syndrome, environmental or societal influences, people, life circumstances, etc.) deter you from accomplishing any goals you have set for yourself.</p>

                <p>Seek as much help as you can. Whether it's from faculty, friends, or organizations, the more help you have to navigate college will help you tremendously in your journey to succeed.</p>

                <p>It's perfectly normal not to have everything figured out from the start; trust the process, be open to new possibilities, and let your status as a first-gen student be a source of pride.</p>

                <h3>First-Gen Mentor Meet</h3>
                <p>Interested in a post-graduate education, advice for navigating undergrad, or seeking out a mentor for the upcoming school year? Join the First-Gen Gateway in the atrium of the Student Activities Building for snacks and a first-of-its-kind “speed mentoring” event! We’ve assembled a cohort of first-generation graduate students (MPP, MBA, and more!), law students, and PHD students for “speed-dating” styled small-group discussion and socializing. Attendees will have an opportunity to engage for a set time with each of the potential mentors, and formally connect with them if they would like to seek a mentor/mentee relationship.</p>
