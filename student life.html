            <h2>Who we are</h2>
            <p>We believe in fair and equitable access to food and other basic resources. Because when each of us has what we need, our community is stronger and our students are more successful.
                This website has been created to share information about the resources available to students. It’s also a place to share data and research that will help the U-M community understand how important this work is for the entire campus.
                This work is led by Student Life and supported by academic units and campus partners. Because more resources are being discovered and created on a regular basis, this website will be updated often. Please be patient as we grow this important resource. </p>
